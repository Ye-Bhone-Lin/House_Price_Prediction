# House Price Prediction
This project contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices using various regression techniques.

### Project Structure
- app.py: The Flask web application script.
- home.html: HTML template for the web application.
- house_price_prediction(Machine Learning).ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- housing.csv: Dataset used for training the model.
- requirements.txt: List of dependencies required for the project.

### Model
The project explores various regression models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

### Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score. Detailed results and comparisons are available in the Jupyter Notebook.
